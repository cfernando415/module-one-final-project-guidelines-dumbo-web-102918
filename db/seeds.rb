Fish.create(species: "Black Bass", habitat: 'freshwater lakes and ponds', description: "a greenish to grey fish with black blotches forming horizontal stripes along its flanks. Adults are found in deeper watees and feed on other fish, shrimp, and occassionally maring mammals and birds.", rarity: 0.1)
Fish.create(species: "Trout", habitat: "streams and lakes", description: "A large heavy fish that fills the diets of many land mammals such as bears and humans. Its coloration often matches its habitat as a form of camouflage. Feeds on smaller fish and bugs.", rarity: 0.1 )
Fish.create(species: "Perch", habitat: "lakes", description: "Small, somewhat long and rounded fish. They feed on smaller fish, shellfish and bug larvae, and can be caught with almost any bait. They have paired dorsal and pelvic fins, along with a set of dorsal fins, the first of which is spiny and the second soft.", rarity: 0.1)
Fish.create(species: "Guppy", habitat: "lakes, ponds, rivers, streams", description: "a smaller fish with a large amount of sexual dimorphism. Males tend to be colorful and decorative, females less so. They feed on benthic algae and aquatic insect larvae. Due to their small size, they have many natural predators.", rarity: 0.22)
Fish.create(species: "Frog", habitat: "ponds, lakes", description: "This isn't a fish! Throw it back!", rarity: 0.05)
Fish.create(species: "Salmon", habitat: "Saltwater, returns to rivers to breed", description: "Typically, salmon are anadromous: they hatch in fresh water, migrate to the ocean, then return to fresh water to reproduce. However, populations of several species are restricted to fresh water through their lives. Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot where they hatched to spawn. Tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true. A portion of a returning salmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems; the percent of straying depends on the species of salmon. Homing behavior has been shown to depend on olfactory memory. Salmon date back to the Neogene.", rarity: 0.1)
Fish.create(species: "Goldfish", habitat: "literally any freshwater", description: "The goldfish (Carassius auratus) is a freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae of order Cypriniformes. It is one of the most commonly kept aquarium fish. A relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the Prussian carp and the crucian carp), the goldfish is native to East Asia. It was first selectively bred in Ancient China more than a thousand years ago, and several distinct breeds have since been developed. Goldfish breeds vary greatly in size, body shape, fin configuration and colouration (various combinations of white, yellow, orange, red, brown, and black are known).", rarity: 0.11)
Fish.create(species: "Catfish", habitat: "inland or in coastal waters, freshwater environments, shallow and running water", description: "Extant catfish species live inland or in coastal waters of every continent except Antarctica. Catfish have inhabited all continents at one time or another. Catfish are most diverse in tropical South America, Asia and Africa with one family native to North America and one family in Europe. More than half of all catfish species live in the Americas. They are the only ostariophysans that have entered freshwater habitats in Madagascar, Australia, and New Guinea. They are found in freshwater environments, though most inhabit shallow, running water. Representatives of at least eight families are hypogean (live underground) with three families that are also troglobitic (inhabiting caves). One such species is Phreatobius cisternarum, known to live underground in phreatic habitats. Numerous species from the families Ariidae and Plotosidae, and a few species from among the Aspredinidae and Bagridae, are found in salt water. In the Southern United States, catfish species may be known by a variety of slang names, such as 'mud cat', 'polliwogs', or 'chuckleheads'. These nicknames are not standardized, so one area may call a bullhead catfish by the nickname 'chucklehead', while in another state or region, that nickname refers to the blue catfish.", rarity: 0.11)
Fish.create(species: "Bluegill", habitat: "shallow waters of many lakes and ponds, along with slow-moving areas of streams and small rivers", description: "The bluegill occurs naturally in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains from coastal Virginia to Florida, west to Texas and northern Mexico, and north to western Minnesota and western New York. Today they have been introduced to almost everywhere else in North America, and have also been introduced into Europe, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Asia, South America, and Oceania. Bluegills have also been found in the Chesapeake Bay, indicating they can tolerate up to 1.8% salinity. In some locations where they have been transplanted, they are considered pests: trade in the species is prohibited in Germany and Japan. In the case of Japan, bluegills were presented to the then-crown prince, Akihito in 1960 as a gift by Richard J. Daley, mayor of Chicago. The prince, in turn, donated the fish to fishery research agencies in Japan from which they escaped, becoming an invasive species which has wreaked havoc with native species, specifically in Lake Biwa in Shiga Prefecture. The emperor has since apologized. Bluegill live in the shallow waters of many lakes and ponds, along with slow-moving areas of streams and small rivers. They prefer water with many aquatic plants, and hide within fallen logs or water weeds. They can often be found around weed beds, where they search for food or spawn. In the summer, adults move to deep, open water where they suspend just below the surface and feed on plankton and other aquatic creatures. Bluegill try to spend most of their time in water from 60 to 80 °F (16 to 27 °C), and tend to have a home range of about 320 square feet (30 m2) during nonreproductive months. They enjoy heat, but do not like direct sunlight - they typically live in deeper water, but will linger near the water surface in the morning to stay warm. Bluegill are usually found in schools of 10 to 20 fish, and these schools will often include other panfish, such as crappie, pumpkinseeds, and smallmouth bass.", rarity: 0.1)
Fish.create(species: "Arapaima", habitat: "Amazon", description: "Among the worlds largest freshwater fish, and adult can reach lengths of three meters. A torpedo shaped with large blackish green scales and red markings. Streamlined and sleek, with its dorsal and anal fisn set near its tail. Its diet consists of fish, crustaceans, and small land animals that walk near the shore.", rarity: 0.01)
